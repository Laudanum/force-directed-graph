[…] Rather than thinking of the struggles as relating to one another like links in a chain, it might be better to conceive of them as communication like a virus that modulates its form to find in each context an adequate host. […]</p>\n\n<p>It would not be hard to map the periods of extreme intensity of these cycles. A first wave might be seen as beginning after 1848 with the political agitation of the First International, continuing in the 1880s and 1890s with the formation of socialist political and trade union organizations, and then rising to a peak after the Russian revolution of 1905 and the first international cycle of anti-imperialist struggles. A second wave arose after the Soviet revolution of 1917, which was followed by an international progression of struggles that could only be contained by fascisms on the one side and reabsorbed by the New Deal and antifascist fronts on the other. And finally there was the wave of struggles that began with the Chinese revolution and proceeding through the African and Latin American liberation struggles to the explosions of the 1960s throughout the world. These international cycles of struggles were the real motor that drove the development of the institutions of capital and that drove it in a process of reform and restructuring. Proletarian, anti-colonial, and anti-imperialist internationalism, the struggle for communism, which lived in all the most powerful insurrectional events of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, anticipated and prefigured the processes of the globalization of capital and the formation of Empire. In this way the formation of Empire is a response to proletarian internationalism. There is nothing dialectical or teleological about this anticipation and prefiguration of capitalist development by the mass struggles. On the contrary, the struggles themselves are demonstrations of the creativity of desire, utopias of lived experience, the workings of historicity as potentiality.</p>\n\n<p><code>Reprinted by permission of the publisher from EMPIRE by Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri, pp.50-52, Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, Copyright © 2000 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College.</code></p>",

      "artist": "Julia Kristeva",
      "content": "<p>One word on everyone's lips in May '68 was \"contestation.\" It expresses a fundamental version of freedom: not freedom to change or to succeed, but freedom to revolt, to call things into question.<!--more-->Thirty years on, because of technology and liberalism, we're so used to identifying freedom merely with free enterprise that this other version doesn't seem to exist; it's got to the point where the very notion of liberty is fading in people's minds and absent from their actions. Remember, liberty-as-revolt isn't just an available option, it's fundamental. Without it, neither the life of the mind nor life in society is possible. I mean \"life\" here, and not just maintenance, repetition, management. The telling moment in an individual's psychic life, as in the life of societies at large, is when you call into question laws, norms and values. You can't deplore the \"death of values\" and discount the movements that question them, as some are doing. Because it's precisely by putting things into question that \"values\" stop being frozen dividends and acquire a sense of mobility, polyvalence and life. There was no nihilism in the contestation that burned up that month of May 1968; instead it was a violent desire to rake over the norms that govern the private as well as the public, the intimate as well as the social, a desire to come up with new, perpetually contestable configurations. This desire for an exhilarating and joyful \"permanent revolution\" was perhaps just part and parcel of young people abreacting their \"second Oedipus,\" i.e. their adolescence, on the back of an obsolete State and a prurient consumer society. But by all accounts, it was sexual and cultural contestation that spearheaded events, and young people were rightly mistrustful of the political \"co-opting\" the trade unions and left-wing parties tried to impose on that \"spring,\" as well as the workers' intrinsic \"consumerism.\" It's still true, though, that the general strike and the social movement that shook up the country can be interpreted, from a distance, as the symptom of something altogether new. On the one hand it was the desire of the most disadvantaged citizens - the \"humiliated\" and the \"offended\" - to claim a dignity beyond and actually in spite of the political structures that had usually served them since the industrial revolution. On the other, this also indicated the final stage of the \"proletariat\" in the sense of a homogenous class and a certain clientele of political parties. While the process of discrediting political frameworks was going on, the \"humiliated\" and \"offended\" became aware that they were subjects who shouldn't be relegated to their status as producers in the system of production. For while keeping up their legitimate claims to better salaries and working conditions, they were also carried away by the demands of subjective freedom. This led them to ask for greater democracy, less centralization and finally, greater happiness for all. And also the right to respect, besides the right to consume. What we describe as the \"advances of democracy\" of these last thirty years includes above all the self-assurance of the poorer classes, daring to claim the same pleasures - if not the same luxuries - as the others. It's a real '68 kind of claim: \"We're realists, we want the impossible.\" Does the impossible mean happiness? The impossible and more - happiness for all.</p>\n\n<p>We often forget that the impulse of the French Revolution of 1789 was a new idea, happiness for the greatest number of disadvantaged people. This wasn't like the American revolution, far more legalistic and federalist in spirit, which offered better management of the contract that rather well-off freeholders were making amongst themselves. Possibly because of my foreign origins, I'm more sensitive than most to the difference that exists between these two revolutions, and to the fact that in France there is a people which hasn't forgotten it carried out the most radical of the bourgeois revolutions. The most violent, certainly, and its consequences are still problematic, but the most grounded in the miserable reality that is still the lot of our continent. It was also linked to Christian and Rousseauistic ambitions of dignity for all. The youthful contestation of May 1968 wasn’t blind to that tradition, and its rejection of the Communist or Socialist parties didn’t make it any the less attentive to the social movement - on the contrary.</p>\n\n<p><code><em>Revolt, She Said </em>copyright © 2002 by Semiotext(e).

      "artist": "Julia Kristeva",
      "content": "<p>In contemporary society the word revolt means very schematically political revolution. People tend to think of extreme left movements linked to the Communist revolution or to its leftist developments.<!--more-->I would like to strip the word \"revolt\" of its purely political sense. In all Western traditions, revolt is a very deep movement of discontent, anxiety and anguish. In this sense, to say that revolt is only politics is a betrayal of this vast movement. People have reduced, castrated and mutilated the concept of revolt by turning it only into politics. Therefore if we still want to conquer new horizons, it is necessary to turn away from this idea and to give the word revolt a meaning that is not just political. ? try to interpret this word in a philosophical and etymological sense. The word revolt comes from a Sanskrit root that means to discover, open, but also to turn, to return. This meaning also refers to the revolution of the earth around the sun, for example. It has an astronomical meaning, the eternal return. On a more philosophical level, since Plato, through St. Augustine and until Hegel and Nietzsche, there is a meaning that ? wanted to rehabilitate and that you would find equally rehabilitated by Freud and Proust. It is the idea that being is within us and that the truth can be acquired by a retrospective return, by anamnesis, by memory. The return to oneself leads the individual to question his truth, much like what is accomplished with philosophical dialogues, for example Plato's. Something that prayer and all forms of meditation also accomplish according to St. Augustine. ? think that Freud gave a new meaning to this retrospective return by asking psychologically troubled patients to search for memories of their traumas and to tell their stories. Why is this both different from the tradition and analogue to it? It is analogue because it is always about searching for the truth through a return to the past in the sense of Plato and St. Augustine. On the other hand it is different because Freud does not think that we can stabilize our-selves in a contemplation of God or Being. Stability is provisional. It is the conflicts that are eternal because there is pleasure in conflict. The individual, in this return to him or herself, experiences division, conflict, pleasure and jouissance in this fragmentation. This is the modern vision of psychic truth. ? think that in the automated modern world the depth of psychic life, the liberation of psychic life, the search for truth in the interrogation and the questioning are all aspects that are overlooked. We are expected to be performing entities. At best, we are asked to work well and to buy as much as possible. This whole problematic of interrogation, of the return to the self, the questioning and the conflicts that are sources of human freedom have become obliterated, rejected or even destroyed parameters. The culture that arises from this situation is a culture of entertainment rather than one of interrogation and revolt. ? would say it is an essential kind of resistance in a technocratic society to rehabilitate memory along with the questioning and to allow the conflicts of the individual to take place, thus creating a culture that would satisfy these needs.[…] The question of Nothingness is essential as an aspect of freedom. But what is the meaning of nothingness: the possibility to rebel, to change and to transform. With a computer you simply store data as such. But the idea of a transformative creativity that emerges through nothingness and through questioning are parameters that are completely dismissed.</p>\n\n<p>[…] Anxiety, repulsion, nothingness are essential aspects of freedom. That's what revolt is. When one abolishes revolt that is linked to anxiety and rejection, there is no reason to change. You store things and keep; storing. It's a banker's idea, not an idea of a rebel, which spreads this technocratic ideology.\r\nWhat ? am trying to say is that the meaning of revolt, which could be taken as revolution, would reduce the concept to socio-political protests. This constitutes a betrayal of revolt. […]\r\nIn my practice ? try to keep social conditions in mind, so that when someone speaks about his or her financial difficulties or political questions ? am willing to listen to these questions. But it is also true that it is not the role of psychoanalysis to prepare people for union activism or to become members of political parties, whether left or right. What concerns me essentially is to provoke people's anxieties and to free their creativity.</p>\n\n<p>[…] What I want to rehabilitate is the idea to revolt as permanent anxiety. Heidegger speaks of annihilating [anéantir], not of negation in the logical sense of the term, as part of a process leading to repulsion of negativity and rejection. This constitutes a fundamental anxiety which is in fact the foundation of freedom.</p>\n\n<p>[…] What I am saying is that one shouldn’t deny the anxiety of the unemployed, the anxiety of the adolescent, the anxiety of women, which are all integral parts of existence. […] The artist’s goal is to find the representation of this state of anxiety. It’s not a question of claiming that this does not exist or to accept living in marginality, but to represent this revolt in order to survive.</p>\n\n<p><code><em>Revolt, She Said </em>copyright © 2002 by Semiotext(e).

In the 'Systematically Altered Photographs', the image was photocopied, then the copy copied and so on, for about a dozen times. The altered image was then juxtaposed with the original, with the readings drawing attention arbitrarily to certain features and details. The original image was cut from a magazine. There was no sense of creating the image, only of recreating it within a new system. The source was a promotional publication put out for overseas consumption by the Australian government…The clichéd character of the images was important.\" [Talk, Melbourne, 1988]</p>\n\n<p><code>Courtesy of Avril Burn, Estate of Ian Burn. <em>Ian Burn: Minimal-Conceptual Work 1965-1970</em>, exhibition catalogue, ed.
